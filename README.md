# DSE_Data_Visualization_Final_Project
Repository of the Data Science &amp; Engineering course DSE 241 - Data Visualization's Final Project for SecurityCyberGeek. The dataset for this project is the "Cyber Security Attacks" on Kaggle and this project is reference for the "Accelerating the SOC: How Data Visualization Cuts Threat Analysis Time" article on Medium.com.


## README: Running the Cybersecurity Attacks Tableau Application

### Overview

This project presents a visualization of cybersecurity attack data using Tableau. The dataset consists of 25 metrics and 40,000 records, including timestamp, source IP, destination IP, protocol, packet length, malware indicators, attack types, severity levels, and more.

### Prerequisites

To run the Tableau application, ensure you have the following:

Tableau Desktop (or Tableau Public if applicable)

The provided Tableau Workbook file (Cyber_Security_Attacks_Visualization.twbx)

The dataset file (cybersecurity_attacks_updated.csv, if not embedded in the workbook)


### Installation and Setup

**Install Tableau**

If you do not have Tableau installed, download and install Tableau Desktop from Tableau's official website.

**Open the Tableau Workbook**

Locate the Cyber_Security_Attacks_Visualization.twbx file.

Double-click the file to open it in Tableau.

**Verify Data Source (if necessary)**

If the dataset is not embedded, Tableau will prompt you to locate the cybersecurity_attacks_updated.csv file.

Click "Edit Data Source" and navigate to the dataset file location.

Ensure all fields are correctly mapped before proceeding.


### Running the Application


**Navigate the Dashboard**

Once the workbook opens, navigate through the available dashboards and worksheets.

Use filters and interactive elements to explore different aspects of cybersecurity attacks.


**Interact with Visualizations**

Hover over charts to view tooltips.

Click on filters (e.g., attack type, severity level) to drill down into specific details.


**Analyze Insights**

Review trends, anomalies, and key patterns in the cybersecurity attack data.

Compare attack types, affected locations, and response actions taken.


**Exporting and Sharing**

To export visualizations, click on File > Export and choose an image, PDF, or PowerPoint.

To share insights, publish the workbook to Tableau Server or Tableau Public if applicable.


### Troubleshooting

Data not loading? Ensure that the CSV file path is correct and data fields match the expected format.

Performance issues? Large datasets may slow down visualization loading. Consider using data extracts.

Missing visualizations? Check that all calculated fields and data relationships are properly set up.


### Additional Notes

Ensure your dataset is updated and matches the expected structure.

If using a different version of Tableau, some features or layouts may vary.

For further assistance, refer to Tableau's official documentation or seek help from the project team.
